# re_data

# What is re_data?
re_data lets data teams compute various metrics about their datasets and later on:
  - test
  - visualize
  - find anomalies in those

re_data is meant to help data teams find, debug data problems and sleep well knowing they they will know if something unexpected happens.

re_data works strictly inside your data warehouse - by doing transformations on your tables. It let's you improve your data without it needing to leave your data warehouse.

# Getting started

Check out [docs :notebook_with_decorative_cover:  :notebook_with_decorative_cover:](https://re-data.github.io/re-data/docs/introduction/whatis)

# Source code

As dbt packages currently need to be a seperate github repos, most of source code of re_data can be found [here](https://github.com/re-data/dbt-re-data)

# Community

Join [Slack](https://www.getre.io/slack) for questions about using re_data and discussion with people making it :slightly_smiling_face:


# Integrations

We support most of the main data warehouses supported by dbt. We plan to add support for Spark (now officially supported by dbt).
