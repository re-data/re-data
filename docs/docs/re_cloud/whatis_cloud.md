# What is re_cloud?

re_cloud enables you to store and collaborate on reports from different open-source and custom build data apps. (including re_data)

At lof of data apps produce reports in the form of html applications which are very usefull. We believe deploying those reports on your S3 or GCS is quite limiting and we as a data community can do much better 😊 

We heard numours questions on how to deploy re_data and this pushed as into starting re_cloud for our, but also other data apps users 😊
